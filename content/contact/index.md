## How to Contact Me Simply
Email me at <a id="9dda4e98_2" href="#9dda4e98_2" onclick="this.innerHTML='&#x202e;'+'moc'+'&#x2e;'+'liamydnav'+'&#x40;'+'nahoj'+'&#x202d;'">[click to show]</a>

## How to Contact Me Securely
These are some easy ways to securely send me a message with end-to-end encryption.

### Tutanota
Tutanota is my primary email address, and you can sign up with an account for free at [tutanota.com](https://mail.tutanota.com/signup) to send me an encrypted message at: <a id="9dda4e98_3" href="#9dda4e98_3" onclick="this.innerHTML='&#x202e;'+'moc'+'&#x2e;'+'liamydnav'+'&#x40;'+'nahoj'+'&#x202d;'">[click to show]</a>

### Protonmail
I also have a protonmail account. You can sign up for free at [proton.me](https://account.proton.me/signup) to send me an encrypted message at: <a id="9dda4e98_4" href="#9dda4e98_4" onclick="this.innerHTML='&#x202e;'+'moc'+'&#x2e;'+'liamnotorp'+'&#x40;'+'navjj'+'&#x202d;'">[click to show]</a>

### Element.io/Matrix.org
This is another encrypted chat app, but the cool part is that anyone can run a server, and you can talk to anyone on any server. If you already have an account, you can send a message to `@jjvan:matrix.org`. If you don't have an account yet, you can talk to me by following this link and creating an account: [https://app.element.io/#/room/#johanv:matrix.org](https://app.element.io/#/room/#johanv:matrix.org)

Note that this particular room is public, so anyone can see what you say there. But once you sign up, you can also send me an encrypted direct message by clicking on my name and clicking "Start a chat" which appears in the right panel.
