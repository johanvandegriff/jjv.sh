(coming soon)

We provide file storage and sync with Nextcloud, an open source collaboration platform. In addition to files, it comes with many other features including calendars, contacts, encrypted video calls, notes, polls, and RSS feeds. For photo sharing, we also host a Piwigo instance where you can post photos in public and private albums. All your files are encrypted and stored on Tardigrade, a decentralized storage network, so that there is no single points of failue.
