<p>(coming soon)</p>
<p>We provide file storage and sync with Nextcloud, an open source collaboration platform. In addition to files, it comes with many other features
    including calendars, contacts, encrypted video calls, notes, polls, and RSS feeds. For photo sharing, we also host a Piwigo instance where you
    can post photos in public and private albums. All your files are encrypted and stored on Tardigrade, a decentralized storage network, so that
    there is no single points of failue.
