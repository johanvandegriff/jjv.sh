Lately I've been up to:
 - getting rid of 1 thing per day
 - unpacking physically and mentally from a trip
 - a site where u can order custom stickers: [waldo.jjv.sh](https://waldo.jjv.sh/)
 - a [multi-livestream bot](https://botbot.jjv.sh/) - currently migrating the k8s cluster from digitalocean to oracle cloud free tier
