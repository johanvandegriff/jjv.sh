Lately I've been up to:
 - Editing some goofy videos
 - Trying to finish making a few more songs before the end of the year
 - Livestreaming on this very site, johanv.net, which forwards to twitch, youtube, etc. I play games, make [music](https://jjv.sh/music), write code, and have recently been trying out makeup. More info on the [home page](/)
 - Working on a [bot](https://codeberg.org/johanvandegriff/multistream-bot) that aggregates live chat from twitch, youtube, etc. into one place, forwards commands for other bots between chats as needed, and even gives people nicknames and chats with them
 - Exploring the new Raspberry Pi Pico W, a $6 computer with wifi. I'm writing code for it to connect to OBS (live streaming software) to control actions by pushing buttons on a [macropad](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/pico-rgb-keypad-base?variant=32369517166675). I have a [previous version](https://codeberg.org/johanvandegriff/StreamPico/) working, but that was before the Pico W came out, so it uses the Pico and a bluetooth module
 - Prototyping a handheld game for under $10, the [last one](https://jjv.sh/atinygame) was under $1 but was very limited. I have decided on the RP2040 for the processor, and for the display I am considering two options: a [Monochrome Nokia 5110](https://diode.zone/w/ewCzMX7Jg4Fi7jgaKiZkdx) and a [Color TFT](https://diode.zone/w/wkv2DcqwzyVDn1GMxS6USX)
 - Surfing [Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@johanv), since there are a lot of new users [for some reason](https://time.com/6229230/mastodon-eugen-rochko-interview/) :]
 - pettin da [doggo](https://jjv.sh/lucy)
 - Working at my tech job
