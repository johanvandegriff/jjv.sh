Lately I've been up to:
 - Getting back into making music
 - Livestreaming on this very site, jjv.sh, which forwards to twitch, youtube, etc.
 - Working on a [bot](https://botbot.jjv.sh/) that aggregates live chat from twitch, youtube, etc. into one place, forwards commands for other bots between chats as needed, and even gives people nicknames and chats with them
 - Prototyping a handheld game for under $10, the [last one](https://jjv.sh/atinygame) was under $1 but was very limited. I have decided on the RP2040 for the processor, and I am investigating [a 128X64 I2C ST7567S display](https://www.tztstore.com/goods/show-7817.html)
 - Surfing [Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@johanv)
 - Working at my tech job
