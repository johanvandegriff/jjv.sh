Here are some limericks that I wrote for an assignment to tell my story.

```
Johan is one quarter Lebanese,
And three quarters white as swiss cheese.
He’s spent so long in MoCo,
That he’s started to go loco,
And he plans to take a trip overseas.
```

```
In 5th grade he became a Boy Scout,
And liked to make fires and camp out.
He advanced up in rank,
Supportive family to thank,
And got Eagle before the time ran out.
```

```
In High School he built many a robot,
But never gave the plan enough forethought.
They were piles of metal,
Duct taped to a tea kettle,
But they advanced to Worlds on a longshot.
```

```
Tinkering is Johan’s main token.
From this there’s a proverb he’s spoken:
For in work or in playing,
He lives by the saying,
If you can’t fix it, it ain’t broken.
```

```
When he was bored he played board games,
In Dominion and Boggle he scored claims,
But when railroads got gold studded,
Monopoly got cold-blooded,
And the friendships descended toward flames.
```

```
On February 14, what’s he doing?
Not sending cards, giving candy, or wooing.
He’s in his room with a CD,
Reading a tutorial wiki,
Installing Arch Linux on his PC.
```

```
Johan’s become opposed to Google,
The Internet kit and caboodle.
He wants to stop being tracked,
And get privacy back,
But all of it’s just too dang useful.
```

```
Now Johan’s a college freshman,
Studying for a lofty profession.
He’ll be a double E,
Hitting the books with glee,
Until he runs into crippling depression.
(Just kidding :)
