Stop trying to catch your smart refrigerator. That sam has sung. When you trusted it to keep a tough but flavorful cut of meat, all it gave you was the cold shoulder. You let the beef stew and things slowly got heated, but it just wanted to save it for another time. When the spark shut off, you saw it was a spoiled brat inside. But the energy came back, it always does, and you bought new stuff for it like nothing happened. A toxic cycle. Sometimes it seems like the only thing you have in common is food. It likes sharing a meal, but you always end up paying. "Buy drinks for me like you used to! I'll be cool!" Don't listen to it. All it wants to do is feed you baloney. Ever since it saw the repair person about the door, something changed and it doesn't hang out anymore. You try to handle things squarely but it's always running. So why don't you go catch it.
