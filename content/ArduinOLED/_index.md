ArduinOLED is a platform for electronic games and other projects. It includes an OLED screen, a joystick, some buttons, a buzzer, and alligator clip connection points to interface with many other devices. You can see the [board design on EasyEDA](https://oshwlab.com/jjvan/OLED_Arduino-55422f17ec8149338d246987e5e87bc4).

If you have a question or comment, or a project you made with this board, or if you would like to purchase one, send me and email.
