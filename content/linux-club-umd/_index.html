<h1>Linux Club at UMD</h1>
<p>We are a group of students that are passionate about Linux for various
reasons, including usefulness for developers, software freedom and open
source, customizability, utility in server setup, understanding computers
better,	etc. We all come together with our different interests and learn
from each other for the benefit of the whole group.</p>

<h2>Meetings</h2>
<p>Check <a href="meeting/">this page</a> for our meeting info</p>

<h2>Knowledge Base Wiki</h2>
<p>We maintain a <a href="wiki/">wiki</a> with articles on how to use Linux. The topics range from <a href="https://umd-linux.com/wiki/basics/caps-lock-ctrl">turning caps lock into control</a> to more advanced topics such as <a href="https://umd-linux.com/wiki/intermediate/server-no-public-ip">accessing a server with no public IP address.</a></p>

<h2>Kernel Panic</h2>
<p>Kernel Panic was the Linux Club's spring 2019 hackathon (the 2020 hackathon will be called <a href="http://libre.pizza/">Libre Pizza</a>). The unique part is that we disconnect from the internet halfway through, and rely on local services that we set up. These include a mirror of wikipedia and stackoverflow (with <a target=_blank href="https://www.kiwix.org/en/">Kiwix</a> and <a target=_blank href="https://akhenakh.github.io/gozim/">Gozim</a>), a local <a target=_blank href="https://nextcloud.com/">Nextcloud</a> instance, a local <a target=_blank href="https://devdocs.io/">devdocs.io</a> server, and local Linux package mirrors (such as <a target=_blank href="https://www.linuxmint.com/mirrors.php">Linux Mint</a>). The first one was in April 2019; here's a photo of the setup:</p>
