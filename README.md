# jjv.sh
my personal website

Here's the progression of how I deployed this site to the various domains and the reasoning behind it at the time:
* [how i created: johanv.xyz](https://jjv.sh/blog/how-i-created-johanv-xyz/)
* [how i created: johanv.net](https://jjv.sh/blog/how-i-created-johanv-net/)
* [how i created: jjv.sh](https://jjv.sh/blog/how-i-created-jjv-sh/)

Currently, this uses a [custom fork of owncast](https://codeberg.org/johanvandegriff/hugowncast) that I combined with hugo in the same codebase, and it is deployed on a home server with docker-compose and caddy.
