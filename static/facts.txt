I have a random fact generator on my website.
These fun facts are stored in jjv.sh/facts.txt Shh, don't tell anybody, then they could view all the facts! ;)
I enjoy playing piano! I was classically trained and now I just play and compose for fun. I can't read sheet music in real time so I play mostly by ear. I have released an <a target="_blank" href="https://odysee.com/@johanv:5/internal-travels:d">album with my piano music</a>, complete with a drawing for each song.
One time I was playing piano in a hotel lobby when someone asked me to play for him and his girlfriend, and then he proposed to her!
My favorite movie is The Incredibles.
My favorite color is <span style="color: blue">blue</span>. No, <span style="color: orange">orange</span>! No, <span style="color: purple">purple</span>! I'm indecisive...
Within the span of May-June 2019, my phone, laptop, and tablet all broke. I switched to a flip phone and a crappy laptop for about a year until I was able to get a better laptop and a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.pine64.org/pinephone/">PinePhone</a>.
I used the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.pine64.org/pinephone/">PinePhone</a> for about a year. It's open hardware and runs Linux (or almost any OS including Android or Windows, but why would you do that).
My phone is the <a target="_blank" href="https://shop.fairphone.com/fairphone-4">Fairphone 4</a>, which is sustainable and repairable.
I've never been outside the United States. I came close when my family visited Maine and almost stepped over to Canada, but it would have been an extra 2 hour drive, so we decided against it.
My social security number is 015-68-3185. Just kidding! Or am I? Quick -- reload the page so no-one sees!
One of my favorite tabletop games is Dominion, a deck-building strategy game. I own the base set and 10 expansion boxes.
When I was a baby, I turned <span style="color: orange">orange</span> because I ate too many carrots and sweet potatoes. It was... a UGE moment for me.
I love to create electronic games and projects with Arduino boards! My first big project was a Whack-A-Mole game inspired by the Make Magazine volume 24's "Zap-A-Mole."
I did FTC robotics in highschool on team 7393; I was the co-programmer. Go <a target="_blank" href="https://ftc7393.org">electron Volts</a>!
I technically lived in a basement for 2 years. Whether that basement was fully furnished or was in fact 2 separate basements over that time period is up for speculation.
I have run a few D&D one-shot games and I wish I had time for more.
I still play Minecraft sometimes. These kids with their newfangled comparators and observer blocks put my old redstone contraptions to shame!
I almost played Fortnite once.
My favorite computer game as a kid was The Incredible Machine: Even More Contraptions. I can still play it, now using Wine on Linux -- glad we kept the CD!
My favorite computer game is Nethack, a roguelike from 1987 that is still being developed today. I have a 5 game win streak with a different class each game, despite death being permanent (no restoring to save points).
One of my favorite games is Teeworlds, a side-scrolling capture-the-flag first-person-shooter and-other-dashed-words game. I am currently the person on Odysee with the most views on <a target="_blank" href="https://odysee.com/@johanv/owning-some-noobs-on-teeworlds">Teeworlds videos</a>.
I dabble in digital art with a Framework 12. Sometimes I play <a target="_blank" href="https://drawception.com/player/962191/epjane/drawings/1/">Drawception</a> to practice and have fun.
I try to use mostly free and open source software, for example Krita instead of Photoshop, Libreoffice instead of Microsoft Office, Nextcloud instead of Google Drive. It saves a lot of money and it's a joy to be free of the tech giants!
I use Xournal++ for note-taking -- you should try it if you have a drawing tablet or touchscreen laptop!
My siblings and I have been making and filming little skits and stories since we were young. We used to edit them on Windows Movie Maker (yikes!), but now I use Kdenlive and Shotcut and my brother uses DaVinci Resolve.
I don't drink coffee or tea (except sometimes iced tea). But recently I tried some Ethiopian coffee and it was good.
I have stopped buying water bottles because I just keep losing them. Instead I just buy a juice bottle and reuse it.
I carry around a USB with 15 different boot options, including some Linux distros, utilities, and backup software.
I always wish I had more time for things, but when I sometimes do, I waste it on things I hadn't wished I had time for, like writing these fun facts. (Although sometimes the unintended tasks are fun, like writing these fun facts.)
My Linux distro hop journey has been: Cygwin (on Vista family computer) → Ubuntu (my own desktop!) → Arch (after Ubuntu upgrade killed the OS) → Ubuntu (new laptop for college!) → Mint → Qubes → Manjaro → Pop!_OS → Mint → Ubuntu Studio → Manjaro → Arch (on new frame.work laptop) → Garuda → Manjaro → Ubuntu → Ubuntu Studio.
My favorite operating systems are Ubuntu Studio (installed on my laptop), eOS (on my phone), QubesOS (used it for a few years), Ubuntu (on my servers), Manjaro (on one of my servers), Kali (on a virtual machine), and Raspbian (on my Raspberry Pi boards). You give me freedom of choice, and I choose multiple!
Arch Linux was my valentine in 2016 (I installed it on Valentine's Day). I remember burning a CD and reading the Arch wiki to muddle my way through the install process. These days I am much lazier so I just install whatever works easiest.
I am 1/4 Lebanese and 3/4 white as Swiss cheese.
My friend and I set up a Nextcloud server in my basement to replace Google Drive, Calendar, etc.
I was homeschooled until college. Every year, my family would start the first week of school at a remote cabin in the woods. As part of the trip, we always made the "cabin video," documenting the trip and including a skit that we came up with at the cabin and improvised props and costumes based on whatever we happened to have. Gems such as "Goldilocks and the 3 Campers," "Cabin Olympics," "Senior Survivors," "Stories from Summer Camp."
I was in Boy Scouts as a kid and one of the trips we went on was Philmont, a week of hiking, tomahawk throwing, climbing, and other activities.
My Mom tells me that when I was 18 months old, I put a 20-piece puzzle together really fast. Guess you could say I'm a prodigy, no big deal.
I recently graduated from UMD College Park with a Computer Engineering degree.
I changed the CAPS Lock key on my keyboard to be a Ctrl key to improve keyboard posture. I also changed right Ctrl and Alt to be Home and End.
I buy computer monitors from the thrift store for $10-$30 each and use them for desktop computers for me and my family/friends.
I am lucky enough to never have had a Facebook. Right when I was thinking I might cave and get one, the privacy revelations came out, and I decided to never sign up. I'm super glad, since they can be a pain to delete.
The first programming language I learned was Bash, from a book my Dad gave me called <a target="_blank" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/293206.UNIX_Shell_Programming">UNIX Shell Programming Revised Edition</a>. The book was released in 1989 and I read it around 2009. I remember being fascinated by the fact that you could create a phonebook program to store all your contacts using files, and display them with cool ASCII art formatting. I still have <a target="_blank" href="https://git.sr.ht/~johanvandegriff/unix-shell-programming-revised-edition-programs">the old programs I wrote</a>.
My favorite programming languages in order are Python, Bash, Go, C, and Java. One of my least favorites is PHP, although I did use it to make this site... (update: the site has been <a target="_blank" href="https://jjv.sh/blog/how-i-created-johanv-net/">migrated</a> away from PHP :) But now one of my least favorites is JavaScript, which I had to use to make this button...
I just started playing chess more seriously (on <a target="_blank" href="https://lichess.org/@/jjvan">lichess</a>) and I'm still terrible at it.
I learned the basics of how to salsa dance.
I created a streaming service called <a target="_blank" href="https://asciiradio.jjv.sh">asciiradio</a> for text and audio only, so I could stream from mobile data.
My Mom uses Linux Mint.
One of my favorite shows is Callisto 6, a tabletop RPG livestream show about superheroes in a cyberpunk setting.
I've been learning Golang and Elixir recently since I want to take advantage of concurrent programming.
I use <a target="_blank" href="https://greggman.com/downloads/examples/html5bytebeat/html5bytebeat.html">html5bytebeat</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://sonic-pi.net/">Sonic-Pi</a> to make music with code.
In 2021 there was a <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/johanvandegriff?tab=overview&from=2021-05-01&to=2021-05-31">gap in my github commits</a>, which suspiciously correlated to the months where I was the most unhappy and isolated during the pandemic. :[
I can control my lights from my phone... with a janky servo attached to the light switch powered by a Raspberry Pi Zero.
I joined Mastodon in 2017 before it was cool. (It still isn't cool.)
I have played in a nethack relay race with the creator of Doki Doki Literature Club. The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEW56wBgy7s">saga</a> began when he transformed into a dragon and laid an egg. Then the save file was passed along to other streamers, including me eventually.
